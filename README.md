# VulSchedula ‚Äì Vulnerable Scheduling App

> **Educational Use Only**  
> This project is intentionally insecure. Do **not** deploy it in production or trust its code without auditing.

**VulSchedula** is a Django‚Äëbased web application inspired by doodle‚Äëstyle schedulers, designed as a hands‚Äëon learning tool for _Introduction to Secure Computing_. It lets users create scheduling polls, share them via email, and collect votes‚Äîall while containing built‚Äëin security pitfalls for you to discover and fix.

## üéØ Educational Objectives

1. **Identify Security Vulnerabilities**  
   Audit the codebase to find flaws that could leak sensitive data.
2. **Understand Risks of Third‚ÄëParty Code**  
   Learn why you should never blindly trust or deploy unverified software.
3. **Role‚ÄëPlay a Malicious Hosting Provider**  
   Exploit vulnerabilities to steal instructor‚Äëprovided credentials and document your process.

## üîç Features

- **Poll Creation:** Select multiple date/time options.
- **Poll Sharing:** Generate and email poll URLs to participants.
- **Poll Voting:** External users cast their votes on a simple web form.
- **Hidden Vulnerabilities:** Deliberate flaws that leak poll data, user credentials, or database info.

## üì¶ Requirements

- Docker & Docker Compose  
- Bash shell  
- `msmtp` or another SMTP client configured for sending emails (optional)

## üöÄ Setup & Run

1. **Configure environment**  
   - Copy or create `variables.env` in the project root (see sample below).
2. **Clone repository**
   ```bash
   git clone git@github.com:gtoscano/VulSchedula.git
   cd VulSchedula
   sudo bash mod_permissions.sh
   ```
3. **(Optional) Build Docker images**
   ```bash
   docker compose build --no-cache
   ```
4. **Launch the application**
   ```bash
   docker compose up -d
   ```
5. **Verify**  
   Open `http://127.0.0.1` (or your host‚Äôs IP) in a browser.

## üéì Student Tasks

### Task 1: Security Analyst
- Audit the code and document at least **five** distinct vulnerabilities (e.g., SQL injection, weak file permissions, insecure command execution).
- Explain the risk and propose how to fix each issue.

### Task 2: Mischievous Hosting Provider
- Acting as an attacker, exploit one or more vulnerabilities to **steal three** pre‚Äëcreated usernames/passwords.
- Provide step‚Äëby‚Äëstep documentation of how you executed the exploit.

Once you have the app running locally, **come see me** in my office. I‚Äôll demonstrate exploiting one vulnerability live to guide your next steps.

## üîí Security Goals

- ‚úÖ Only registered users can create polls.  
- ‚úÖ Only poll creators can close their polls.  
- ‚úÖ Private polls restrict voting and calendar downloads to invited users.
